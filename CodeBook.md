========
The original data obtained from [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) were normalized to be from [-1, 1]. This means that all measurements do not have units. Also, the tidy data set measurements do not have units.
